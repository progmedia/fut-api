FUT Data Grab Demo
==================

# Stuff we don't have yet:#

- Look-up using player's name (this uses IDs which you have to manually look up elsewhere)
- Player Position - we can only retrieve basi position like 'Midfield' and not LM/LW/RWB etc.
- Handle 'Known as' names in a more advanced way / truncation of long names.
- Nationality flag - think we have to grab our own flags by nation ID.
- Deal with card types other than gold/silver/bronze....aka legend/TOTY/etc etc
- More in-depth stats like strength etc
- Storing retrieved data in our own DB
- Store all the images on our own servers instead of being leaches!
- The ability to remove Barnsley altogether
